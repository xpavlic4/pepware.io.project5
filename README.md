Parker works a day job and when he comes home in the evening he likes to cook for himself.  The only problem is, he never has ingredients on hand.  He needs something to help him plan out his meals for the week

Make Parker a shopping list generator.  Parker would like to be able to:
* Enter the names of recipes
* Enter the ingredients of a recipe
* Be able to pick from a list of recipes what meals to have this week
* Print out a shopping list with all the ingredients he needs

If you want to go the extra mile:
* Keep track of what he has on hand
* Keep track of sides and suggest meals + sides that fit with the shopping list
* Integrate with an internet grocery ordering service and place the order automatically.
